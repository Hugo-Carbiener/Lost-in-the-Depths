We made this game in 48 hours during the [Unijam 2022](https://www.ensiie.fr/unijam-2021/). The objective was to create a game, in a team, inspired by the theme

As a space miner, you are sent on an unknown planet to harvest its precious gem. Will you be able to dwell to the depths of this world, where oxygen becomes to most precious resource, and fulfill your task ?

### How to play ? 

You are equipped with a portable mining laser and a grappling hook. Use these tools to mine through a **procedurally generated** ground and reach biomes filled with different ores. The gem you are looking for is hidden deep inside the planet. As such, **oxygen** will come to lack as you make your way down. Your base is equipped with an oxygen pump, which keep you alive. But it will not be enough! You will therefore have to may your way back up to your base and use some of your harvest to **upgrade your tools**.
